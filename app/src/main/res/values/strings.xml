By practicing soil conservation, including appropriate soil preparation methods, they reduce soil erosion and increase soil stabilization.\n\nThese soil conservation methods allow for healthy soil formation, soil fertility and favorable soil composition, including soil permeability and soil porosity, which lead to increased soil health. Soil organic matter is a critical component of soil health. Cover crops can help maintain or increase soil organic matter. By using a variety of soil management practices, soil organic matter will increase while soil erosion will decrease, keeping soil nutrients on the farm.

    <string name="pitext">Majra pest is very harmful to rice. This insect enters the stem of the rice plant and destroys the stem. As a result, the yield of rice decreases. Corn borer attack reduces yield by 13 to 26 percent. However, heavy infestations can result in 30 to 70 percent yield loss. Hence pest control is very important for rice cultivation. The Agricultural Information Service has given advice on how to control this pest in rice.\n\n\n1. When perching on the stalks in the field, the birds sit down and eat insects and moths. If an outbreak of adult moths is observed, light traps should be placed near the paddy fields to collect and destroy the moths. 2.
